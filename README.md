# BPANationals2015
The solution to the BPA Nationals prompt in 2015. 

### What is this?
There is a competition called Business Professionals of America. They give us a prompt and a limited amount of time to solve it. We compete to solve as much of the problem as we can in a limited amount of time.

At National Level, students that were the top of their states are invited to compete. BPA has 23 states, meaning 3-5 students from each state would have been invited. However, some students were unable to attend, lowering calculated numbers just a bit. There were quite a few competitors though.

We are given an hour and a half at National level to develop the piece of code given on the prompt. Before writing the code, part of our time must be allocated to thorougly reading the prompt and rubric and understanding the task at hand. The rubric scores each component of the prompt separately, giving students the chance to prioritize certain tasks over others. In the event of a tie, the student who finishes earlier wins, so most students who win the competition do not take up the entire time unless completely necessary.

Although the code appears to be a short and simple solution, much of your time in the room is spent analyzing the prompt for details that could be overlooked and acquire penalties against your score.

This prompt specifically was dedicated to calculating the distance between a set of GPS Coordinates using the Haversine function.

The formula had to be quickly interpreted and implemented.

### Notes on this Competition

It is interesting to note that in this competition there were severe errors in the prompt that made it difficult to complete it accurately. They provided a source of test data without answers to verify our algorithms. The other example data provided (written as text on the prompt) incorrectly placed New York and Paris in the same location.

The judges were quick to respond to a few of my questions, and provided replacement example data they pulled from Google. However, this still did not verify the accuracy of the algorithm. 

### How did this rank?
First in the Nation.
